## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

1. Learn to use media query with CSS custom properties for responsive design.
2. Learn to use react useState to manage the opening and closing of the details element.

### Continued development

1. I haven't implemented animation on the opening and closing of the details element, which I want to implement in the future.
2. Getting confused with the React's useState and getting issues like glitching likely due to rerendering. I should aim to further improve my understanding on this topic.
